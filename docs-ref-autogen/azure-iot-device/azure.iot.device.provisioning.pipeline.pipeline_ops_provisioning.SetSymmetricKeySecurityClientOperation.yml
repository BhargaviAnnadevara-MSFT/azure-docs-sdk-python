  summary: 'A PipelineOperation object which tells the pipeline to use a symmetric
    key security client.

    Some pipeline stage is expected to extract arguments out of the security client
    and pass them

    on so an even lower stage can use those arguments to connect.


    This operation is in the group of provisioning operations because security clients
    are currently

    very provisioning-specific'
