  summary: 'A PipelineOperation object which contains connection arguments which were
    retrieved from a

    X509 security client likely by a pipeline stage which handles the

    SetX509SecurityClientOperation operation.


    This operation is in the group of Provisioning operations because the arguments
    which it accepts are

    very specific to DPS connections and would not apply to other types of client
    connections

    (such as a Provisioning client).'
