  summary: 'Base class representing various actions that can be taken

    when the state_based_provider is connected.  When the PipelineAdapter user

    calls a function that requires the state_based_provider to be connected,

    a StateBasedProviderAction object is created and added to the action

    queue.  Then, when the state_based_provider is actually connected, it

    loops through the objects in the action queue and executes them

    one by one.'
