        between common resource files and task resource files is that common

        resource files are downloaded for all subtasks including the primary,

        whereas task resource files are downloaded only for the primary. Also note

        that these resource files are not downloaded to the task working

        directory, but instead are downloaded to the task root directory (one

        directory above the working directory).  There is a maximum size for the

        list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request will

        fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this

        occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can

        be achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers.'
