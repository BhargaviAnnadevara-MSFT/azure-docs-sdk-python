        run on the specified pool. You must ensure that the pool referenced by

        this property exists. If the pool does not exist at the time the Batch

        service tries to schedule a job, no tasks for the job will run until you

        create a pool with that id. Note that the Batch service will not reject

        the job request; it will simply not run tasks until the pool exists. You

        both.'

        a completed state, and the pool creation error is set in the job''s

        scheduling error property. The Batch service manages the lifetime (both

        creation and, unless keepAlive is specified, deletion) of the auto pool.

        Any user actions that affect the lifetime of the auto pool while the job

        is active will result in unexpected behavior. You must specify either the
