# Installation

## Which Python and which version to use
There are several Python interpreters available - examples include:

* CPython - the standard and most commonly used Python interpreter
* PyPy - fast, compliant alternative implementation to CPython
* IronPython - Python interpreter that runs on .Net/CLR
* Jython - Python interpreter that runs on the Java Virtual Machine

**CPython** v2.7 or v3.4+ and PyPy 5.4.0 are tested and supported for the Python Azure SDK.

## Where to get Python?
There are several ways to get CPython:

* Directly from [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* From a reputable distro such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), [Enthought](https://www.enthought.com/) or [ActiveState](https://www.activestate.com/)
* Build from source!

Unless you have a specific need, we recommend the first two options.

## Installation with pip

You can install each Azure service's library individually:

```bash
pip install azure-batch          # Install the latest Batch runtime library
pip install azure-mgmt-scheduler # Install the latest Storage management library
```

Preview packages can be installed using the `--pre` flag:

```bash
pip install --pre azure-mgmt-compute # will install only the latest Compute Management library
```

You can also install a set of Azure libraries in a single line using the
`azure` meta-package.

```bash
pip install azure
```

We publish a preview version of this package, which you can access using
the --pre flag:

```bash
pip install --pre azure
```

## Install from GitHub

If you want to install `azure` from source:

    git clone git://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python.git
    cd azure-sdk-for-python
    python setup.py install

## Install an older version with pip
You can install an older version of `azure` by specifying 'azure==3.0.0' verion details.
```bash
pip install azure==3.0.0 
```
## Check SDK Installation details with pip
You can check `azure` sdk installation location, verstion details etc
```bash
pip show azure # Show installed Version, location details etc.
pip freeze  # List installed packages, including editables.
pip show azure # Output installed packages in requirements format.
```
## To Uninstall with pip
You can uninstall all Azure libraries single line using the `azure` meta-package.
```bash
pip uninstall azure 
```
