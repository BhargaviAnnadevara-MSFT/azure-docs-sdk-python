  summary: 'A PipelineOperation object which wraps the common operation of sending
    a request to iothub with a request_id ($rid)

    value and waiting for a response with the same $rid value.  This convention is
    used by both Twin and Provisioning

    features.


    Even though this is an base operation, it will most likely be generated and also
    handled by more specifics stages

    (such as IoTHub or MQTT stages).


    The type of the request payload and the response payload is undefined at this
    level.  The type of the payload is defined

    based on the type of request that is being executed.  If types need to be converted,
    that is the responsibility of

    the stage which creates this operation, and also the stage which executes on the
    operation.



    Example is the id of the operation as returned by the initial provisioning request.'
