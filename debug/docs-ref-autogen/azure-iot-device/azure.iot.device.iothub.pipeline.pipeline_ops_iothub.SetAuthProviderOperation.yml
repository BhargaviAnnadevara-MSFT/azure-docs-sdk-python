  summary: 'A PipelineOperation object which tells the pipeline to use a particular
    authorization provider.

    Some pipeline stage is expected to extract arguments out of the auth provider
    and pass them

    on so an even lower stage can use those arguments to connect.


    This operation is in the group of IoTHub operations because autorization providers
    are currently

    very IoTHub-specific'
