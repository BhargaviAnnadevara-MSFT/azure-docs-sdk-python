  summary: 'A PipelineOperation object which tells the pipeline to "enable" a particular
    feature.


    A "feature" is just a string which represents some set of functionality that needs
    to be enabled, such as "C2D" or "Twin".


    This object has no notion of what it means to "enable" a feature.  That knowledge
    is handled by stages in the pipeline which might convert

    this operation to a more specific operation (such as an MQTT subscribe operation
    with a specific topic name).


    This operation is in the group of base operations because disconnecting is a common
    operation that many clients might need to do.


    Even though this is an base operation, it will most likely be handled by a more
    specific stage (such as an IoTHub or MQTT stage).'
