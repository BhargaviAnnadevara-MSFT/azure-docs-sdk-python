  summary: 'This stage is responsible for serializing connect, disconnect, and reauthorize
    ops on

    the pipeline, such that only a single one of these ops can go past this stage
    at a

    time.  This way, we don''t have to worry about cases like "what happens if we
    try to

    disconnect if we''re in the middle of reauthorizing."  This stage will wait for
    the

    reauthorize to complete before letting the disconnect past.'
