  summary: 'A base class for data objects representing events that travels up the
    pipeline.


    PipelineEvent objects are used for anything that happens inside the pipeine that

    cannot be attributed to a specific operation, such as a spontaneous disconnect.


    PipelineEvents flow up the pipeline until they reach the client.  Every stage

    has the opportunity to handle a given event.  If they don''t handle it, they

    should pass it up to the next stage (this is the default behavior).  Stages

    have the opportunity to tie a PipelineEvent to a PipelineOperation object

    if they are waiting for a response for that particular operation.'
