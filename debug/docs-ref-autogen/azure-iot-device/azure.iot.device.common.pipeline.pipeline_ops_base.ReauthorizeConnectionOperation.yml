  summary: 'A PipelineOperation object which tells the pipeline to reauthorize the
    connection to whatever service it is connected to.


    Clients will most-likely submit a ReauthorizeConnectionOperation when some credential
    (such as a sas token) has changed and the protocol client

    needs to re-establish the connection to refresh the credentials


    This operation is in the group of base operations because reauthorizinging is
    a common operation that many clients might need to do.


    Even though this is an base operation, it will most likely be handled by a more
    specific stage (such as an IoTHub or MQTT stage).'
