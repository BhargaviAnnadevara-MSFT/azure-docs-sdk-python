  summary: 'A PipelineOperation object which contains a SAS token used for connecting.  This
    operation was likely initiated

    by a pipeline stage that knows how to generate SAS tokens.


    This operation is in the group of base operations because many different clients
    use the concept of a SAS token.


    Even though this is an base operation, it will most likely be generated and also
    handled by more specifics stages

    (such as IoTHub or MQTT stages).'
