  summary: 'A PipelineOperation object which contains connection arguments which were
    retrieved from an authorization provider,

    likely by a pipeline stage which handles the SetAuthProviderOperation operation.


    This operation is in the group of IoTHub operations because the arguments which
    it accepts are very specific to

    IoTHub connections and would not apply to other types of client connections (such
    as a DPS client).'
