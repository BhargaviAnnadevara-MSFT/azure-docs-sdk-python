  summary: 'The purpose of the retry stage is to watch specific operations for specific

    errors and retry the operations as appropriate.


    Unlike the OpTimeoutStage, this stage will never need to worry about cancelling

    failed operations.  When an operation is retried at this stage, it is already

    considered "failed", so no cancellation needs to be done.'
