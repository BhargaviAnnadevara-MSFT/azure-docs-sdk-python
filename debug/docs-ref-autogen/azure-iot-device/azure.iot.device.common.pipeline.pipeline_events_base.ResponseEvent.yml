  summary: 'A PipelineEvent object which is the second part of an RequestAndResponseOperation
    operation

    (the response).  The RequestAndResponseOperation represents the common operation
    of sending

    a request to iothub with a request_id ($rid) value and waiting for a response
    with

    the same $rid value.  This convention is used by both Twin and Provisioning features.


    The response represented by this event has not yet been matched to the corresponding

    RequestOperation operation.  That matching is done by the CoordinateRequestAndResponseStage

    stage which takes the contents of this event and puts it into the RequestAndResponseOperation

    operation with the matching $rid value.'
