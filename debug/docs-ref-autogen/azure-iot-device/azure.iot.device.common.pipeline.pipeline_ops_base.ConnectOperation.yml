  summary: 'A PipelineOperation object which tells the pipeline to connect to whatever
    service it needs to connect to.


    This operation is in the group of base operations because connecting is a common
    operation that many clients might need to do.


    Even though this is an base operation, it will most likely be handled by a more
    specific stage (such as an IoTHub or MQTT stage).'
