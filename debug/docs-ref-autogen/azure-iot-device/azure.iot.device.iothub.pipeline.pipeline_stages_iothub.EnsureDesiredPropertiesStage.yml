  summary: 'Pipeline stage Responsible for making sure that desired properties are
    always kept up to date.

    It does this by sending diwn a GetTwinOperation after a connection is reestablished,
    and, if

    the desired properties have changed since the last time a patch was received,
    it will send up

    an artificial patch event to send those updated properties to the app.'
